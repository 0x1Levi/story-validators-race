# Information

Hey there fam! This is Daniel, a blockchain passionate and founder of Mandragora, a professional staking service provider based in Barcelona, Spain. We have been in the Cosmos ecosystem since 2018. We are currently validating on several main/test networks within the ecosystem, actively relaying in multiple IBC transfer paths, providing endpoints, technical support, etc.

# Networks

 - Evmos (genesis validator on mainnet)
 - Sentinel (genesis validator on mainnet)
 - Umee (genesis validator on mainnet - no longer in the active set)
 - Comdex (validator on mainnet)
 - Hypersign (participating on its incentivized testnet for more than a year and a half)
 - Namada (15 testnet iterations, 1 incentivized testnet, and many other testnets after that - top 1 contributors, top 1 on the incentivized testnet)
 - Side Protocol (testnet - we have participated in its two celebrated incentivized rounds so far)
 - Osmosis (no longer in the active set)
 - Composable (no longer in the active set)
 - Sifchain (the team rugged)

# Contributions

We have mainly focused on Namada for almost 2 years, so I'll highlight some of our contributions as top contributors there.

We backed the creation amd keep maintaining of Undexer (Namada network indexer) and Shielded Live explorer:
- Undexer (https://github.com/hackbg/undexer)
- Shielded Live (https://shielded.live)
### Other contributions but not less important:
- Participating actively on every testnet iteration (actively contributing).
- Mandragora was the first validator team that broke Namada public testnet (iteration nÂº 3; on latest testnet iterations, made it interoperable with Cosmos Hub testnet via IBC (assets were successfully transferred between them, and discovered an issue which was finally related to Heliax's Hermes fork they were using).
- Technical/validator support to validators, and general support answering users' questions about Namada or Anoma.
- Testing out actively chain features and providing feedback on every testnet iteration.
