### Validator Information
Krews was founded by a group of professionals with many years of experience in the industry. We have worked together in the past on different projects and combined our knowledge and experience in the blockchain field to create this structure. Our goal is to use this knowledge to provide the best validator service to projects, communities, and our delegators. We are here to empower your projects, fulfill various needs, and contribute to your sustainable success in the blockchain space.
#### Validator Experience
We operate and have operated validator nodes in networks such as Initia, Avail, Lava, Sunrise, Warden Protocol, Aptos, Stride, Celestia, AlignedLayer, Dymension, Massa, and many others. We ensure reliable and secure node operations, actively participate in network governance, and provide Snapshots, RPC, APIs, and other tools for users. We also provide technical support to the community and share our experience with newcomers. For example, we have an educator role at Avail.
