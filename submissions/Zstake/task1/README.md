This is a unique opportunity to complete a series of tasks and receive test tokens. The race is designed for validators looking to make useful contributions to the Story blockchain network.

## Purpose of the Race

The main goal of the race is to distribute test tokens to validators who actively participate in the network and make meaningful contributions to the project.

## Conditions of Participation
To start the race, you need to complete the first task. After its successful completion and approval via pull request, you will be able to move on to the next stage. Important: the tasks must be completed sequentially. The next step will only be available after the previous step is completed.

> Please note that the STAKEME team may reject your PR if they believe you are a multi-accuser or have not completed the tasks properly. The first task is not subject to appeal.
