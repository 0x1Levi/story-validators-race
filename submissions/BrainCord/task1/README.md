# Hey there! 👋 I'm OWL

## About Me 🌟
I'm a passionate solo-validator who's been on an exciting journey since 2021. My heart beats for web3, and I'm incredibly grateful that I get to live my passion every day. With an unwavering commitment to decentralization and security.

## My Mission
🚀 My current primary focus is 100% dedication to decentralization and protection within the Cosmos ecosystem. I believe in the power of distributed networks and work tirelessly to contribute to their growth and security.

## Infrastructure
I take pride in my robust and diverse infrastructure setup:
- 🌍 Servers rented across multiple global locations
- 🔒 Not dependent on a single provider or location
- 🗺️ Current server locations include:

  - 🇺🇸 United States 

This distributed approach ensures maximum uptime and resilience for the networks I support.
