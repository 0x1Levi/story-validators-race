Synergy Nodes was established in 2019 and brings five years of experience in validating various blockchain projects. Our team is comprised of four members: Aries (Founder and Technical Lead), Capri (Technical Support), Scrop (Technical Support), and Callisto (Business Development Manager).

Our inaugural validator node, Terra Classicâ€”formerly known as Terra, was launched in May 2019. Over the subsequent years, we have gained substantial technical knowledge in securely validating blockchains and providing core infrastructure support for blockchain projects, details of which are listed below. We have expanded our operations and services for 26 mainnets and various testnets.

We have earned recognition from multiple projects, notably Terra, where we are a leading validator managing IBC transfers between Terra and other Cosmos chains.
