## Task 4: Useful utility for validators
- Development of a useful utility for Story blockchain validators
There are no strict criteria for this task. The better you develop the utility, the better chance you have of being selected as the winner. It can be for example rpc scanner

## Submission
To submit your solution, you need to fork this repository. Go to folder `wave-2/submissions`. Then, in the submissions directory, create a folder `your moniker validator`</br>
Create a file `submission-general-task-4.md`</br>
The `submission-general-task-4.md` file should contain link github repository with description how use your utility.

File structure should look like this:
```bash
wave-2
├── submissions
    └── validator_moniker
        └──submission-general-task-4.md
        └──data.json
```
After that, create a Pull Request (PR). It is important to create the title of such a template:
`General-task-4: <your_moniker> validator submission`

> Apart from submission-general-task-1.md, nothing should be in the PR. Make sure in your PR that you do not make unnecessary changes to the main repository.

- 25000 test tokens IP, a total of 5 winners will be selected by the Story team
> The EVM validator address will be taken from your file `data.json` for sending test tokens IP
